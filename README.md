The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. The following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust(Government Corruption) describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country. The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country as stated in the previous answer. If you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.
